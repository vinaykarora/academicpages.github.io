About Me
======
Hi there, I’m Vinay. I am an independent **Consultant Software Engineer** from Gurugram, Haryana, India. Vinay help organisations deliver faster and more reliable experiences to their customers. Vinay is full-stack developer and architect with experience in various technologies—including the entire microsoft stack .NET Framework, .NET Core, and front-end technologies (Angular and React). He also has a great hands on experience in the design and optimization of systems. Vinay is an "Movers & Shakers – I Made A Difference" award-winning developer, an individual contributer, and Lead Engineer for PureSoftware.


You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinuarora/), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vinaroar), and [GitHub](https://github.com/vinaykarora).

I joined PureSoftware in 2019 as Lead Engineer for one of their client Aristocrat, and helped build and grow their new products and culture over one year, from legecy application all the way to next generation.

Before that, I worked at Incedo for a few years on Microservices Architecture.

I grew up in Sohna, South Gurugram, which really is lovely, even though there’s a really good chance you’ll freeze to death there.
