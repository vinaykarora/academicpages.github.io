About Me
======
Hi there, I’m Vinay. I am an independent **Consultant Lead Software Engineer** from Gurugram, Haryana, India. Vinay help organisations deliver faster and more reliable experiences to their customers. Vinay is full-stack developer and architect with experience in various technologies—including the entire microsoft stack .NET Framework, .NET Core, and front-end technologies (Angular and React). He also has a great hands on experience in the design and optimization of systems. Vinay is an "Movers & Shakers – I Made A Difference" award-winning developer, an individual contributer, and Lead Engineer for PureSoftware.

With over a decade of professional experience, and more than two years working as an independent consultant, I have been trusted by the likes of the *Aristocrat*, *PureSoftware*, and many more. Through combinations of coding, training, development, support, and consultancy, I have helped my clients to build and scale resilient, performant full-stack systems for a variety of different applications.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinuarora/), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vinaroar), and [GitHub](https://github.com/vinaykarora).

I joined PureSoftware in 2019 as Lead Engineer for one of their client Aristocrat, and helped build and grow their new products and culture over one year, from legecy application all the way to next generation.

Before that, I worked at Incedo for a few years on Microservices Architecture.

I grew up in Sohna, South Gurugram, which really is lovely, even though there’s a really good chance you’ll freeze to death there.

Most importantly, I am *available for hire*. My work spans many industries, countries, and formats. From troubleshooting and assessing existing application issues, to training engineers to debug and avoid these common pitfalls in future; from *advising and consulting* with teams to get a handle on web performance issues, to everything else in between. If you need a faster application, we’ll get you a faster application.

If you think I can help you—and I probably can—*say hello*: I enjoy working with companies of all shapes, sizes, locations, problems, needs, and budgets. I’m professional, but I’m laid back—*drop me a line*, and we can see what fits.
